# The Best Performance / Quality-of-Life Mods for Minecraft 1.20.1

This is the most up-to-date list of the mods that I personally use while playing Minecraft 1.20.1, these mods can also double for older versions of Minecraft so keep that in mind.

# Why can't I download these all in one ZIP file? Why do I have to download them all individually?

Not every mod is legally allowed to be distributed in modpacks. Some mods' license agreements say you can't include their mod in a modpack without explicit permission. Mods also get outdated very quickly and it's important to keep all of these mods updated. Downloading each mod individually is the best way to have the best in-game experience.

# You must install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) to use these mods and [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/) should also work just as well but I have not tested that.
